Thank you for considering this role. As part of our recruitment process, we invite you to participate in this take-home assignment tailored for the Jr. Frontend Developer position. This exercise is an opportunity for you to demonstrate your technical skills, coding style, and approach to problem-solving in a practical context.

We value your time and effort in completing this task and hope you find it both challenging and enjoyable. It's a chance for us to see how you approach and solve real-world problems, and for you to get a taste of the kind of work we do.

## Problem Description

### Project Overview

Your task is to develop a web page based on a provided design. This exercise is designed to evaluate your ability to accurately translate a design into a functional HTML page, demonstrating your attention to detail, proficiency in HTML and CSS, and ability to work with provided assets.

### Specifics of the Task

1. **Design Implementation**
   - You will be provided with images of the web page design. The images are present in the `screens` directory. Your task is to replicate these designs as closely as possible in HTML and CSS.
   - Pay close attention to layout, spacing, font choices, and color schemes to ensure your page closely matches the provided design.
2. **Assets**
   - All necessary assets, such as images and icons will be provided.
   - You are expected to use these assets appropriately to achieve a result that is faithful to the design.
3. **Responsiveness**
   - It is important to make the page responsive to different screen sizes.
   - The page should maintain its visual integrity and usability across various devices.
4. **Interactivity**
   - The page doesn't need to be dynamic, but basic interactivity (like hover effects) is encouraged to enhance user experience.

### Deliverables

Upon completion of the assignment, please follow these steps to submit your work:

1. **Create a New Git Repository:**
   - Initialize a new Git repository in your project directory.
   - Ensure the repository includes:
      - The HTML page.
      - The CSS file.
      - The assets directory.
      - The `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files.
   - Please **do not include** the `node_modules` directory in your repository.

2. **Commit and Push Your Code:**
   - Commit your code to the Git repository.
   - Push the commit(s) to a new repository on GitHub.

3. **Share the Repository Link:**
   - Once your code is pushed, please share the link to the repository with me. You can send the link via email to me.

4. **Include a README File:**
   - In the repository, include a README file that explains:
      - Your approach to the assignment.
      - Any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.
   - This README is crucial for understanding your thought process and problem-solving approach.

### Points to Note

- The provided design should be considered as a final client requirement. Your ability to deliver a product that matches the client's expectation is key.
- Focus on the quality of your code, including its structure, readability, and comments where necessary.
- While external libraries can be used, over-reliance on them for basic styling may negatively impact the evaluation of your fundamental CSS skills.
- The deadline for assignment submission is **9:00 AM, Monday, January 22nd, 2024**. Please submit your work before the deadline to ensure it is evaluated on time.

### Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated on:

- **Accuracy:** How well does your page match the provided design?
- **Code Quality:** Cleanliness, organization, and efficiency of your code.
- **Attention to Detail:** Alignment with the design elements and overall aesthetics.
- **Responsiveness and Interactivity:** Adaptability to different devices and basic user interactions.

## Getting Started with the Assignment

To ensure a smooth start to your project, we've set up some initial steps. Following these steps will help you get up and running with the provided HTML page and the Node.js HTTP server, which you'll use to serve your page.

### Step 1: Clone this repository

You can either download the repository as a ZIP file or clone it using Git. 

### Step 2: Review the Provided HTML Page

Youâ€™ll begin your assignment with a basic HTML page. This page is configured to be the starting point of your project.

### Step 3: Setting Up Node.js

If you haven't already, you will need to install Node.js. This can be done by visiting the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and downloading the installer for your operating system.

### Step 4: Serving the HTML Page with Node.js

After installing Node.js, follow these steps to serve the HTML page using the Node.js environment:

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where your project is located.
   - Run the command **`npm install`**.
   - This will install **`http-server`** and any other necessary dependencies as defined in the **`package.json`**.
2. **Start the Server:**
   - In the same directory, run the command **`http-server`**.
   - This will start a local web server.
3. **Accessing Your Page:**
   - Open a web browser and go to **`http://localhost:8080`**.
   - You should see the provided HTML page being served.

By using the **`package.json`** file provided, we ensure that you have all the necessary tools and versions required for this assignment. It is important to run **`npm install`** to correctly set up your environment before starting development.

### Important Notes

- **Do Not Alter the Server Configuration:** The **`http-server`** setup provided should not be changed. This ensures consistency in how the application is run and evaluated.
- **Focus on Design Implementation:** Your primary task is to modify and enhance the provided HTML page to match the design image. The server setup is merely a tool to help you view your progress.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with setting up Node.js or the **`http-server`**, please refer to the respective documentation or reach out for assistance.

# README: My Approach

## Getting Started
I began by reading the instructions in full, viewing the provided screen images, and looking at all of the provided assets to get an idea of expectations and how to start. I wrote all of the HTML first. 

## Mobile Responsive approach
I chose to tackle the responsive styling with a mobile-first approach because although the site will probably be used primarily in a desktop context, in my experience mobile-first is more efficient in the long term and helps eliminate unexpected issues.

## Challenges
-Getting the background image to be responsive. I was able to achieve this by using the background-size property.
-I wish the hover for the link would also affect the icon
