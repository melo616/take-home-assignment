# README: My Approach

## Getting Started
I initiated the project by reading the instructions in full, reviewing the provided screen images, and examining all provided assets to gain an understanding of expectations and a clear starting point. Prior to delving into CSS, my initial task was completing the HTML structure, which helped me develop a mental model of the project. 

## Mobile Responsive approach
I chose to tackle the responsive styling with a mobile-first approach. While the site's primary use might be in a desktop context, in my experience mobile-first is more efficient in the long term and helps prevent unexpected formatting issues.

## Styling Order of Operations
- I began by establishing the overall layout to move elements to roughly the correct positions.
- After building the layout, I matched the color palette and styled the navigation sidebar.
- Next, I added the background image to the main section, tweaked the flex layout, and ensured responsiveness of both of these to match the mockups.
- Following the main section, I addressed the styling of the cards, including their background images, header links, graphics, and other content.
- With the foundational styling in place I added the icons, interactive elements, and final accents.

## Challenges
During the development process, I encountered a number of challenges and gained a lot of insights which will help me become more efficient at front end design in the future.
- **Responsive background image:** This was the biggest challenge that I faced initially, as I didn't have a solution in my existing toolbelt. I successfully addressed this by using the background-size property, a property I hadn't previously used extensively but was able to understand through some helpful articles.
- **Graphics in card styling:** My original approach was to place the cards' background graphics using absolute positioning. This worked but subsequently caused issues with layering and formatting as I continued styling. I realized background image was a much more effective way to handle this design, and this was a good learning experience for card styling overall.
- **Font selection:** I utilized websites that supposedly have the ability to identify font from an image, but unfortunately the fonts provided had some key differences from the one used in the mockup. I explored a number of widely-used fonts I was already familiar with and selected Lato as this was the closest in my opinion. 
- **Color matching:** To ensure color representation faithful to what was used in the mockup, I uploaded the mockup to Figma and used their eyedrop tool. As I've been very recently introduced to Figma, I was really pleased with how straightforward and effective this feature is.
